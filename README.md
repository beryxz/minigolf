## Description

Mini Golf Resort is a simulator of miniature golf courses, where you control the ball in first person and aim to score all holes in the fewest strokes possible.

## Game Mechanics

### Controls

The game aims to be simple and easy to play, requiring only the mouse to control all the various aspects of the golf ball. As can be seen in the instructional section in the main menu, these are the available commands:

- Control the camera zoom using the mouse wheel
- Change the orientation of the ball by moving the mouse horizontally
- Change the throwing power by left-clicking the mouse while moving it vertically
- Throw the ball by right-clicking the mouse
- View the Scoreboard with "Tab"
- Pause the game with "Esc"

### Gameplay Mechanics

The various holes in the course provide mechanics to show how balls react to different scenarios. These mechanics include:

- Slopes and Jumps to show the effect of gravity on the ball whilst also making the game more fun to play
- Different physical properties for the ground materials: grass and sand provide different friction values and drag resistance to simulate how different ground materials make the holes harder
- Bouncy walls have higher bounciness compared to standard walls and, therefore, make the ball bounce in an unexpectedly fun way around the course.
